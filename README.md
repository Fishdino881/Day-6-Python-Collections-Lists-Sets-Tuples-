# Day-6-Python-Collections-Lists-Sets-Tuples-

This repository documents my learning and practice of Python collection data types, focusing on lists, sets, and tuples.
These collections allow storing multiple values in a single variable and are essential for writing efficient and structured Python programs.

🔹Lists

Lists are one of the most commonly used data structures in Python.

Characteristics:

 Defined using square brackets `[]`
 Ordered collection
 Mutable (can be changed)
 Allows duplicate values
 Supports indexing and slicing

Common List Methods:

 `append()` – Add an element
 `remove()` – Remove a specific element
 `insert()` – Insert at a specific index
 `sort()` – Sort the list
 `reverse()` – Reverse list order
 `clear()` – Remove all elements
 `index()` – Find index of an element
 `count()` – Count occurrences

Lists can be iterated using a `for` loop and are ideal when data needs frequent modification.

---

🔹 Sets

Sets are useful when working with **unique values**.

Characteristics:

 Defined using curly braces `{}`
 Unordered collection
 Does not allow duplicate values
 Indexing is not supported
 Elements cannot be modified directly, but can be added or removed

Common Set Methods:

 `add()` – Add an element
 `remove()` – Remove an element

Sets are often used for removing duplicates and performing mathematical set operations.

---

🔹 Tuples

Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable.

Characteristics:

 Defined using parentheses `()`
 Ordered collection
 Immutable (cannot be changed)
 Allows duplicate values
 Faster than lists when data does not need modification

Available Tuple Methods:

 `count()` – Count occurrences
 `index()` – Find index of an element

Tuples are preferred when data integrity and performance are important.

📊 Comparison Table

| Feature     | List   | Set     | Tuple |
| ----------- | ------ | ------- | ----- |
| Ordered     | Yes    | No      | Yes   |
| Mutable     | Yes    | Partial | No    |
| Duplicates  | Yes    | No      | Yes   |
| Indexing    | Yes    | No      | Yes   |
| Performance | Medium | Medium  | High  |

---

✅ Conclusion

* Use lists for flexible and dynamic data
* Use sets when uniqueness matters
* Use tuples when data should not change and performance matters

Understanding these collections helps in writing clean, efficient, and optimized Python code.
